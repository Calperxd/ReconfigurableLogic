- Quartus II 13.0sp1 (64-bit) Web Edition
- TERASIC CYCLONE II EP2C35 Development & Education BOARD

# Lab6

First of all we must imagine how our IC look like, the image below shows the IC.

The code snippet related to the behavior of decode is the bellow vhdl code

The pin planning is based on board **TERASIC CYCLONE II EP2C35 Development** and for this IC the pin planner looks like the image below
